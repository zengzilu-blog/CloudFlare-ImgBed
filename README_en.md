> **Please check the announcement for upgrade notes on version 2.0!**


<details>
    <summary>Announcement</summary>

## Pinned

1. If you encounter issues during deployment or usage, please carefully read the documentation, FAQ, and existing issues first.
2. **Note**: This repository is a remake of the [Telegraph-Image](https://github.com/cf-pages/Telegraph-Image) project. If you like this project, please support the original one as well.

## 2025.2.6 Version 2.0 Upgrade Notes

> The v2.0 version has been released, with many changes and optimizations compared to v1.0. However, the beta version may have potential instability. If you prefer stability, you may delay updating.
>
> Due to **changes in the build command**, this update requires **manual operation**. Please follow these steps:
>
> - Sync your forked repository to the latest version (ignore if already synced automatically)
> - Go to the Pages management page, enter `Settings` -> `Build`, edit the `Build configuration`, and set the `Build command` to `npm install`
> - All new version settings have been **migrated to the Admin Panel -> System Settings** interface, so generally no need to configure environment variables anymore. Settings made in the system settings interface will **override** environment variable settings. However, to ensure compatibility of images uploaded via the Telegram channel with the old version, **please keep any previously set Telegram-related environment variables!**
> - After confirming the above settings are correct, go to the Pages management page, enter `Deployments`, and `Retry` the last failed deployment.

## Notification About Switching to Telegram Channel

> Due to abuse of the telegraph image hosting, the upload channel has switched to Telegram Channel. Please **update to the latest version (see the last section of chapter 3.1 for update instructions)** and set `TG_BOT_TOKEN` and `TG_CHAT_ID` according to the deployment requirements in the documentation, otherwise upload functionality will not work.
>
> Also, the **KV database is now mandatory**; if not configured before, please configure it as per the documentation.
>
> For issues, please check section 5 FAQ first.
